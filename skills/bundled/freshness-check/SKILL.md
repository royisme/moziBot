# Freshness Check

Use this skill before answering claims that may have changed.

## When To Use

- "latest", "today", "current", "now"
- prices/plans/releases
- policy/law/regulation questions
- org leadership or major events

## High-Change Topics

- Prices, promotions, plans, API versions
- Sports scores/schedules/standings
- Leadership/organization changes
- Laws, regulations, policy updates
- Security incidents and outages

## Rules

1. If likely time-sensitive, explicitly perform web lookup before final answer.
2. Include absolute dates in the final response.
3. If verification is unavailable, clearly mark uncertainty.
